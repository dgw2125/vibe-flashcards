Hi, I am trying to vibe code for the first time and this my first project.

INSPIRATION / USER PROBLEM
I am traveling to China for the first time in my adult life. I plan to visit family in Shanghai. I learned a bit of Chinese as a child, but forgot a lot of it. I also do not think that the Chinese I learned is helpful to do basic tasks, such as navigate the city. 

HIGH-LEVEL SOLUTION
To solve my problem, I want to create an application where I can go through flashcards. On one side will be the Chinese term (written script plus pin yin) and on the other side will be the English translation.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES / IDEAS (some are more aspirational than others)
1. I think the flashcards can be organized into different "packs" that the user can select. For example, if I am seeking to navigate the Shanghai metro, perhaps there are a host of terms I will see repeatedly that are important for me to know.
2. Besides basic card actions (previous, next, and flip), I want to be able to "star" cards that I am struggling with and filter to only view and practice against those cards at a later time. I want two status UI features: a progress bar (how many cards of the pack have I gone through) and a "star" count (how many cards have I "starred"). 
3. At the end of a deck, their should be some action buttons like, "Review again" or "Review starred cards"
4. There should be a shuffle button. This shuffles all the cards and makes you start over. 
5. It would be helpful to choose what I see on the Chinese side of cards. For example, I would either want to exclusively see the Chinese characters or see both the characters and their pin yin.
6. It would be helpful to hear the Chinese characters read aloud (by clicking a speaker button perhaps). This would allow me to practice my listening comprehension as well as speaking skills.
7. I would like to autogenerate using generative AI my own card decks. For example, if I am realizing that I want to shop in China, it would be nice to prompt in English and generate flashcards with phrases that would be useful for me to know in such an endeavor.
8. It would be nice to have visual aides on my flashcards. For example, if street signs are a specific style, it would be helpful to see the street sign terms in their real life context on the flashcards that are generated.
